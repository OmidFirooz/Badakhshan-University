<?php 
    $query_read = 'SELECT * FROM faculty';

    $result = mysqli_query($conn,$query_read);
    if(mysqli_num_rows($result)>0){
        while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)){
        echo $row['fac_id'].'<br>';
        }
    }
?>

<table class="table table-success table-striped">
    <th>
        <td>No.</td>
        <td>Faculty</td>
    </th>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        
        <td></td>
    </tr>   
</table>



I want to add the record in td tags but I don't know how to do it easier. Would you tell me which ways is possible and which one is the best way?
